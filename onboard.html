            <h2><span class="icon">🏢</span> What Are State Agencies?</h2>
            <p>State agencies are departments of Minnesota government that carry out specific functions. Each agency has a commissioner (like a CEO) appointed by the Governor, and they employ thousands of Minnesotans to deliver services.</p>
